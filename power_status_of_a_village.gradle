# There are N no.of houses in a village. Each house requires a voltage of V volts of
# power for their appliances. 
# The houses are arranged in the form of a matrix(r*c) where N is the order of the 
# matrix. The amount of voltage supplied to each house is calculated as current*resistance.
# where i is row no and r is column no. When the voltage supplied to the houses(i*r)
# matches the value V, the appliances in the house work. The task here is to find
# the no.of houses whose voltage matches with V. If none of the value matche with V,
# display NO POWER.
